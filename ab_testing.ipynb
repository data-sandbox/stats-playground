    "### Designing a Test\n",
    "\n",
    "When designing an A/B test, the following factors are considered:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** Design change has no effect on test outcome\n",
    "- **Type I Error ($\\alpha$):** Probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it should *not* be rejected (false positive)\n",
    "- **Type II Error ($\\beta$):** Probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis when it should be rejected (false negative)\n",
    "- **Power = 1 - $\\beta$:** Probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it should be rejected (true negative)\n",
    "- **$\\sigma^2_0$ and $\\sigma^2_1$:** Variances under the null and alternative hypotheses (can be the same)\n",
    "- **$\\mu_0$ and $\\mu_1$:** Means under the null and alternative hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "For e-commerce applications, Type I Error means deploying a feature change when it actually has no positive effect on conversion rate. Type II Error means *not* deploying a feature change when it actually does have a positive effect on conversion."

    "### Sample Size\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first questions in designing the experiment is \"how large should the sample size be\"? Sticking with e-commerce applications, the following factors must be estimated to determine the minimum sample size:\n",
    "1. **Conversion Rate**: Total number of orders divided by total number of unique visitors.\n",
    "2. **Minimum Detectable Effect Size**: The minimum effect size to make the experiment worthwhile. This is commonly some percent increase in conversion rate, which is connected to a measurable revenue increase. For instance, imagine an e-commerce company with 1 million unique visitors monthly and average basket size of $50. A 1% conversion rate increase would result in a significant $500k revenue increase. In contrast, a small company with only 10k unique visitors monthly would only see a $5k revenue increase which might not be worth the cost of the design change effort.\n",
    "3. **Significance ($\\alpha$):** Type I Error, or the probability threshold that the difference observed in the experiment is statistically significant. Commonly set to 5%. Can also be thought of as accepting a Type I Error (false positive) 5% of the time. \n",
    "4. **Power:** The higher the power, the lower the probability of making a Type II error. Commonly set to 80%. Can also be thought of as accepting a Type II Error (false negative) 20% of the time.\n",
    "5. **Sample standard deviations:** Estimated from historical tests or data.\n",
    "\n",
    "While many equations can be found for estimating minimum sample size, the one presented here is from the textbook [Statistical Rules of Thumb](http://vanbelle.org/chapters/webchapter2.pdf) by Gerald van Belle:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "n = {(\\sigma_0^2 + \\sigma_1^2)(z_{1-\\alpha} + z_{1-\\beta})^2 \\over |\\mu_1 - \\mu_0|^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $z_{1-\\alpha}$ is the z critical value for a given $\\alpha$ (in a one-tailed test), $z_{1-\\beta}$ is the z critical value for given a $\\beta$. Note in a two-tailed test, $z_{1-\\alpha}$ becomes $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$."

    "Selecting input parameters to determine sample size is all about tradeoffs. While the goal may be to minimize $\\alpha$ (i.e. minimize Type I Errors) and maximize power (i.e. minimize Type II Errors), doing so requires more samples.\n",
